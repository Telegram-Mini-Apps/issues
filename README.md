# Telegram Mini Apps Issues

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a single source of platform reports and enhancement proposals.
Developers should use it to report found bugs, find compromise solutions and offer platform enhancements.

## How it works

It's important to note that the Telegram team is unlikely to monitor this repository, so the team surely would 
not know anything about issues created here. That's why it is recommended to create fully described issue here
and reference it in created issue in Telegram application repository. 

So, here is the workflow,

1. Fully describe a bug, provide a code to reproduce it and specify platform. It is greatly appreciated to use
`@tma.js` packages, but developer can still use SDK from Telegram.

2. While it's not mandatory, it's also appreciated by the community to create an issue ticket in the Telegram application
GitHub repository you could find in the next section. Don't forget to add `[Mini Apps]` prefix in title and reference issue
created here in Telegram repo, so other developers could see the connection.
